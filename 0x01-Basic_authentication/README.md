üöÄüîë0x01. Basic authentication üõ°Ô∏èüîê
Simple HTTP API for playing with User model.


Files
models/
base.py: base of all models of the API - handle serialization to file
user.py: user model

api/v1
app.py: entry point of the API
views/index.py: basic endpoints of the API: /status and /stats
views/users.py: all users endpoints

Setup
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt



Run
$ API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app



Routes
GET /api/v1/status: returns the status of the API
GET /api/v1/stats: returns some stats of the API
GET /api/v1/users: returns the list of users
GET /api/v1/users/:id: returns an user based on the ID
DELETE /api/v1/users/:id: deletes an user based on the ID
POST /api/v1/users: creates a new user (JSON parameters: email, password, last_name (optional) and first_name (optional))
PUT /api/v1/users/:id: updates an user based on the ID (JSON parameters: last_name and first_name)
Background Context üìö
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API.

Note: In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system. Instead, use a module or framework that provides it for you (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth in Python-Flask). Here, for learning purposes, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

Resources üìñ
Read or watch:

REST API Authentication Mechanisms
Base64 in Python
HTTP header Authorization
Flask
Base64 - concept

Learning Objectives üéØ
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What authentication means
What Base64 is
How to encode a string in Base64
What Basic authentication means
How to send the Authorization header

Requirements ‚úÖ
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
All your files should end with a new line.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
All your files must be executable.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
All your modules should have documentation.
All your classes should have documentation.
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation.
A documentation is not a simple word; it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

Project Outline üìù
Task #	Task Name	Description
0	Simple-basic-API	Download and start the project from archive.zip. Setup and start the server.
Usage: curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status" -vvv
1	Error handler: Unauthorized	Add a new error handler for 401 status code in api/v1/app.py.
Add a new endpoint in api/v1/views/index.py to test the 401 error.
2	Error handler: Forbidden	Add a new error handler for 403 status code in api/v1/app.py.
Add a new endpoint in api/v1/views/index.py to test the 403 error.
3	Auth class	Create a folder api/v1/auth.
Create a class Auth in api/v1/auth/auth.py.
4	Define which routes don't need auth	Update require_auth method in Auth to handle paths that don't require authentication.
5	Request validation	Update authorization_header method in Auth to return the value of the Authorization header.
Update api/v1/app.py to filter requests using before_request.
6	Basic auth	Create a class BasicAuth that inherits from Auth.
Update api/v1/app.py to use BasicAuth based on environment variable AUTH_TYPE.
7	Basic - Base64 part	Add extract_base64_authorization_header method in BasicAuth.
8	Basic - Base64 decode	Add decode_base64_authorization_header method in BasicAuth.
9	Basic - User credentials	Add extract_user_credentials method in BasicAuth.
10	Basic - User object	Add user_object_from_credentials method in BasicAuth.
11	Basic - Overload current_user	Overload current_user method in BasicAuth to retrieve the User instance for a request.
12	Basic - Allow password with ":"	Improve the method extract_user_credentials in BasicAuth to allow passwords containing :.
13	Require auth with stars	Improve require_auth method in Auth by allowing * at the end of excluded paths.
Example for excluded_paths = ["/api/v1/stat*"]:
/api/v1/users will return True,
/api/v1/status will return False,
/api/v1/stats will return False.


Setup & Usage (revised) ‚öôÔ∏è
